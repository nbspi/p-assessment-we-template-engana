# **Practical Assessment**
## **The Lou Geh Supermarket**
The Lou Geh supermarket is embracing the digital era by establishing a comprehensive
e-commerce platform to enhance customer experience and streamline operations. This
platform will seamlessly integrate supplier management, inventory tracking, customer
profiling, and order processing, ensuring a seamless and efficient shopping experience
for its valued customers.
Each supplier has a unique code, the name of the company and their contact number, as
well as the address of the company.
They record all the items delivered by their suppliers. Each item has a barcode, a product
description, quantity and the cost per unit item as indicated in the delivery receipt. They
have real-time inventory updates to reflect product availability on the e-commerce
platform.
During sales transaction they record the product sold to every customer. They record the
quantity and the unit price of every item, as indicated in the official receipt.
For every customer they record their name, address and contact number. The e-
commerce enables customers to browse the platform, add items to their carts, and
proceed to checkout securely, provide multiple payment gateways to accommodate
diverse customer preferences and ensure seamless transactions, and Offer various
delivery options, including same-day delivery, scheduled delivery, and in-store pickup, to
cater to customer convenience.

## **Task**
1. Create a prototype based on the attached problem
2. Technologies and design to be used are the following:
    * Backend approach - REST -API
    * API Backend -  NodeJS
    * Database - MySQL
    * Frontend - Basic HTML, CSS and Javascript
3. As for your application documentations you need to provide the ff:
   1. ERD
   2. DFD
4. Provide a ```README.md``` containing the setup guide.
5. The application should be published in Github via forked repository and for final version of your prototype you will need to create a ```Pull request``` in Github .
6. You will send the Github link to us thru our email devops@biotechfarms.com on or before ```February 7 2025```.

    ### **Submission format**
    - Repository should show codebase directory directly **DO NOT PUT YOUR CODE BASE IN A ZIP FILE** use git commands instead to push your code-base and further updates.
    - Prototype's latest version should be the default branch of the repository.
    - Provide a READ.ME file on how to install and deploy your prototype, and its prerequisite, software, sdk(if needed), and driver.
